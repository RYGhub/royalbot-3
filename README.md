# Royal Bot the Third

A _(not yet)_ modular multiservice bot written in **Python 3.6**!

Development has just started, so it isn't ready yet for use.

## Dependencies

To install the dependencies (on Linux) you need to install `python3.6-dev` and `libffi-dev`.

- `asyncio`
- `aiohttp`
- `async_timeout` _(actually, not anymore, even in it will be reintroduced soon)_
- `sqlalchemy` to access the Royal Games database
- `markovify` for the /markov command
- `discord` to connect to Discord
- `bcrypt` to encrypt passwords in the database
